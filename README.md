# EGFR-pLM-Pathogenicity

This repository focuses on analyzing EGFR mutations and their impact on therapeutic antibody resistance, leveraging structural modeling and protein language models (pLM). The project integrates patient-specific EGFR mutations with insights from ESM1b to predict variant pathogenicity and explore their roles in therapeutic evasion.

**Figure 1. EGFR Protein Ensemble.** Shows the structural ensemble of EGFR, including extracellular, intracellular, and transmembrane domains. The model features a complex with an antibody and natural ligand (EGF), highlighting the organization of EGFR domains.

**Figure 2. EGFR Mutations and Functional Sites.** Focuses on five cancer-associated EGFR mutations (colored red) that are implicated in cetuximab resistance. Active sites for ATP/kinase binding and antibody binding are annotated to emphasize functional regions.
